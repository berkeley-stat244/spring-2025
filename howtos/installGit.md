title: Installing Git
---

Here are some instructions for installing Git on your computer. Git is the version control software we'll use in the course.

You can install Git by downloading and installing the correct binary from [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

For macOS, we recommend using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) option.

Git comes installed on the SCF, so if you login to an SCF machine and want to use Git there, you don't need to install Git.
