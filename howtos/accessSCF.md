title: Accessing the SCF
---

The SCF is the [Statistical Computing Facility](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing), which provides computational resources for the Department of Statistics. 

For our purposes, the SCF provides access to all the software and resources we will need for class. For much of what we do, it will serve as an alternative to your laptop if you run into problems. For GPU work and for some of the parallelization work it will be the primary resource.

## Get an SCF account

If you don't already have an account, please [request one](https://scf.berkeley.edu/account), indicating you are a student in Statistics 244.

## Access to the Statistical Computing Facility (SCF)

There are two main ways to access the SCF machines. 

1. You can login to our various Linux servers and access a terminal/bash shell that way. Please see [http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/access](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/access).

2. The [SCF JupyterHub](https://jupyter.stat.berkeley.edu) provides browser-based access to a terminal/bash shell, Jupyter notebooks, and more. From a Jupyter notebook, you can select to use Julia as the kernel (the language used for processing code cells).

## Software

Julia (possibly not with all needed packages at the moment), Python (with all needed packages), Git, and Quarto are all available from any SCF machine.
