Here are some guidelines for your presentations.

1. Some general thoughts on the topics are in the [spreadsheet tab on "Scheduled topics"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aLW9xuXWb5u_EjsEsGkZwRaawTj3lbr7pxJvJX4b4q8/edit?pli=1&gid=1821023050#gid=1821023050). I may also email some of you with some additional thoughts. Let me know as you have questions as you are developing your materials.
2. You must meet with me 2-3 days before your presentation so we can discuss your plan for the presentation (in particular the content) and I can help with any re-focusing I think might be useful. **It's your responsibility to talk with me after class, find me in office hours, or make an appointment.**
3. In order to have this meeting be productive, you should have already done much of the work for the presentation before the meeting, in particular having a detailed outline of what you plan to cover, even if some of the details remain to be filled in.
4. Plan on 15-25 minutes for your presentation. It's always easy to go over time, so please walk through your material in advance to adjust the timing. And don't be offended if I suggest you skip over some details if I feel it makes sense. **Do not feel that you need to make your presentation longer to get a better grade.** 
5. I'd like for there to be a qmd file or Jupyter notebook for your material that I can share with the class as part of the course materials. However, I understand that depending on the topic, different formats might make sense, so there is some leeway here. Let me know if you have questions.
6. We will record your presentation as part of the recording for class that day. You'll need to join the Zoom session and sit where I usually sit to connect to the projector (or you can stand in front of the class if you prefer).
7. Plan to have your presentation have a large focus on demonstration. If you wish, you can also have the rest of the class engage in some sort of exercise(s) - e.g., a bit of coding or some brainstorming, etc.
8. For some of the topics, feel free to have the presentation have some flavor of a project. The content can be a combination of general overview of the topic and a deeper look into something you're specifically interested in, including some code development.
