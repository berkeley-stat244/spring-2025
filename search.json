A good minimal solution if don’t already have LaTeX installed (e.g., via MicTeX in Windows or MacTeX on MacOS) is to install tinytex: quarto install tinytex.\nQuarto also runs from the Windows Command shell or PowerShell.\nquarto convert converts back and forth between the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and Quarto Markdown (.qmd) formats. So if you prefer, you can develop in a notebook and then convert to qmd and then render to prepare a nice-looking pdf for problem set/project/presentation submission.\nBy default, quarto uses Jupyter to process code chunks. While this generally works well, for Julia, I think that using the R-based knitr will be a better choice (e.g., the output from running code prints out more nicely). To do so, add engine: knitr to the YAML metadata at the top of the file (if you happen to have an execute stanza, you’ll need to have engine: knitr nested within that stanza). For the knitr engine, you’ll need to have R installed on your computer, with the rmarkdown R package installed. If you do want to use Jupyter, you will probably need to add jupyter: julia to the YAML metadata at the top of the file (jupyter: julia-1.10 on the SCF), and you will need a the IJulia kernel installed – see the howto on accessing Julia.\nFor Python chunks when using the default jupyter engine, if you want all output from multiple commands in a chunk to be printed (without explicitly using print()), you can add the following syntax to the YAML metadata at the top of the file. (Note that, unfortunately, the output will be printed out below the code chunk rather than interspersed with the code, as that is how Jupyter notebooks chunks work.)\nipynb-shell-interactivity: all\nThere is also now a Julia engine for Quarto. I think it has the same downside as the Jupyter engine (all chunk output is printed together after the code chunk and only the last output is printed automatically), but you can try it like this.\nFirst, install the QuartoNotebookRunner Julia package:\n]add QuartoNotebookRunner#main\nThen put engine: julia in the YAML metadata at the top of your Quarto document.",

That has the following implications.\nI expect a corresponding degree of maturity from all students, including the small number of undergraduates who might take the class. Among other things, this means trying to not stress about grading, being comfortable with ambiguity (in terms of content, expectations, and grading), being curious, and fully participating in class, even if you feel a bit uncomfortable because you think it might reveal some lack of knowledge or understanding on your part.\nEvaluation/grading will be somewhat informal and based in part on your contributions to the class community (either to the in-class discussion or the Ed discussion board), as well as completion of problem sets, and my assessment of student project/presentations. See more below.\nFurthermore, I am not an expert in Julia! Part of my motivation for teaching the class was to learn Julia myself (as well as more about working with GPUs), which I’ve done some of in preparation for the class and to some degree will make up for remaining gaps based on my larger expertise in this sort of programming (in particular experience with R and Python).

    "text": "Course requirements and grading\n\nCourse grades\nGrading will be based on a combination of your general participation (in class and on the discussion forum), completion of several problem sets, and some combination of in-class presentation(s) and a project. The presentation/project topics will be fairly flexible and will be determined based on my surveying of class participants and what you are interested in. I have a number of topics I’d like to see covered by student presentation but I am open to other ideas as well. Projects and in-class presentations can be on your own or in pairs.\nTentatively, I’m anticipating the following requirement for projects/presentations – with each student selecting one of:\n\nan in-depth final project\na short final project plus a presentation\ntwo presentations\na single presentation on a meaty topic (or two such if done with a partner)\n\nI’ll need to think more about how that is adjusted if done in pairs. It may simply be an expectation of more in-depth work if a project or presentation is shared.\nI will give more details after the first week of class.\nGrades will generally be As and Bs, unless I assess a lack of engagement on your part.\n\nProblem sets\nPlease prepare your assignments using Quarto (or a Jupyter notebook), output to PDF and submitted to Gradescope. Answers should consist of textual response (and any useful mathematical expressions as appropriate), with key chunks of code embedded within the document.\nYou must include a “Collaboration” section in which you indicate any other students you worked with and describing the nature of any use of ChatBots/LLMs. If you did not collaborate with anyone else (including said AIs), simply state that.\nYou’re welcome to consult with classmates on problem set problems, and I encourage it. You can discuss a problem with another student, brainstorm approaches, and share code syntax (generally not more than one line) on how to do small individual coding tasks within a problem.\n\nYou should not ask another student for complete code or solutions, or look at their code/solution.\nYou should not share complete code or solutions with another student or on Ed Discussion.\n\nRemember this is a small class with one goal that you learn how to effectively program, in Julia in particular. There’s no point in copying code in bulk from another student or a ChatBot, because it won’t help you learn programming/Julia. For that you need to wrestle with the concepts/syntax and develop “muscle memory”.\nI am still considering how I will grade problem sets, given there is no GSI and the nature of the class. They will either be graded complete/incomplete or on a 4 point scale:\n\n0 = no credit,\n1 = partial credit (you did some of the problems but not all),\n2 = generally satisfactory (you tried everything but there were pieces of what you did that didn’t completely/correctly solve or present/explain one or more problems), and\n3 = full credit.\n\n\n\nProjects\nI’m expecting that many of you will want to come up with your own final project. You’ll need to discuss the topic with me in advance. It should involve programming in Julia, though use of Python for GPU computations may be ok too. I may also have a couple project topics that you could choose from if you don’t have a project idea and want to do a project rather than doing class presentation(s).\nYou should use Git to manage the code in your project. The result does not have to be, but could be, a Julia package.\n\n\nPresentations\nI’m planning for student presentations to be a core part of the content of the course. I have some specific ideas of topics that I think would be good, but I am also open to your ideas of topics you’d be excited to dive into and present.\nI expect you to do a deep dive on the topic, and while I don’t expect you to be an expert in a week or two, I do expect you to have done a bunch of research and experimentation and pulled together a clear, in-depth presentation focused on examples/demonstration/code syntax, and be ready to answer questions from the class. I will discuss the focus/goal of the presentation/topic with the student(s) when the topic is chosen and then we’ll have an interim “progress” discussion a few days before the presentation.\nI highly recommend using Quarto to prepare presentation materials, but I am also happy to discuss other possibilities with you. We’ll need to figure out a good way to make the final materials available through the website, probably through pull requests made to the course GitHub site.",

    "text": "Campus Honor Code\nThe following is the Campus Honor Code. With regard to collaboration and independence, please see my rules regarding problem sets above – Chris.\nThe student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” The hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code.\nCollaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result of one’s own independent work.\nCheating: A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating. Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University Center for Student Conduct. In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during the quizzes and exams.\nPlagiarism: To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for example: http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html.\nAcademic Integrity and Ethics: Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two common examples of dishonest, unethical behavior. Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life. They help to build a sense of self-confidence, and are key to building trust within relationships, whether personal or professional. There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines what we are dedicated to doing – furthering knowledge for the benefit of humanity.\nYour experience as a student at UC Berkeley is hopefully fueled by passion for learning and replete with fulfilling activities. And we also appreciate that being a student may be stressful. There may be times when there is temptation to engage in some kind of cheating in order to improve a grade or otherwise advance your career. This could be as blatant as having someone else sit for you in an exam, or submitting a written assignment that has been copied from another source. And it could be as subtle as glancing at a fellow student’s exam when you are unsure of an answer to a question and are looking for some confirmation. One might do any of these things and potentially not get caught. However, if you cheat, no matter how much you may have learned in this class, you have failed to learn perhaps the most important lesson of all.",
